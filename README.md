# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

It helps me to know of the intricacies
of the JavaScript Language.

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the JavaScript language.}

It lets you chose between 4 different options so you can joust a knight in the Medieval version,
play as a tiny creature in Fary Tale version, get a quick laugh in Funny version, or get your yearly dose of love with Romance version.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

I created this software to give the user an out-of-this-world experience. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

For the software I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
